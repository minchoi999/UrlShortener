1. fix navbar not displaying collapsible menu when browser width is small

2. fix all runtime exceptions in all actions in Urls controller (actions except Delete are broken)

3. please make all actions in Urls controller prettier... make buttons consistent, make input forms more consistent, make 
   everything more user-friendly (just urls controller side)

4. [Optional] modify Urls/Index to display a list of Urls in a DataTable format (use https://datatables.net)

5. implement front-end input validation on Urls/Create to only submit Url pattern to the server
   - you can either use jQuery validate
     - easier, but you might have hard time setting it up, because you need configure all the settings before using it
     - https://jqueryvalidation.org/
   - you can also use your custom javascript file to test input against RegEx
     - more difficult, and you will have hard time thinking about how to actually use RegEx
